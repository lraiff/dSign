<button class="collapsible"><strong>What is dSign?</strong></button>
<div class="content">
  <p>dSign is a user-input driven DNA encryption web-based platform that allows users to create their DNA signatures based on their Name, Institution, and Country.
    We use the information to generate a unique DNA signature for the user, which is then dispersed in the encrypted DNA sequence when the user adds a sequence to their profile.
    <br>
    <br>
    The information is transmitted to through our encryption back-end, which generates the encrypted signature and sequence and combines them according to the method of encryption.
    The user is also able to share their sequences securely through our access key system, which generates key files when user wants to send the files to others.

    <br>
    The idea for dSign was conceived in March of 2022 while brainstorming for a class project idea at Boston University.
    The founders, Laura, Aurelia, Zenia, and Sally decided to approach the project from a biosecurity standpoint and decided on a DNA encryption platform that would encode unique signatures within the DNA. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Laura was the fearless leader who fought with database and php language to connect all the moving parts in the back-end of dSign, all the while she organized numerous team meetings.
    <br>
    <br>
    Aurelia enthusiastically took on working out the meat of dSign, our encryption algorithm, and somehow succeeded in enabling all the features that we aimed for. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Zenia organized all our deliverables beautifully (of which there were many) and took up the slack in all the miscellaneous tasks that popped up like whack-a-mole.
    <br>
    <br>
    Sally browsed many html and css help sites to pull together a functional face of dSign, with occasional help from Laura. 
    <br>
    <br>
    And after long months of March and April, the platform was completed and continues until today. \o/

<button class="collapsible"><strong>How to Use dSign?</strong></button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Step 1: Create a user profile using our registration page!
    <br>
    <br>
    Step 2: From the Nav bar, click create signature to make your own unique DNA signature.
    <br>
    <br>
    Step 3: From the Profile page, click Add Sequence button to add your sequences. 
    <br>
    Note that if you change your signature after adding a sequence, you must input the sequences again to update the signatures within encrypted sequences!
    <br>
    <br>
    Step 4: View, Export, Send, or Delete your added sequences from the Profile page.
    <br>
    <br>
    Please see our other FAQ questions on how to use the Send and Export options!

<button class="collapsible"><strong>Reversible vs. Irreversible encryption?</strong></button>
<div class="content">
  <p>
    <strong>Reversible:</strong> This encryption method should be used for computational work or other works not involving physical manufacturing of the sequence. 
    When choosing the reversible encryption method, parts of the signature are dispersed inside the sequence based on locations determined during the encryption.
    Because signatures are not recognizable in its entirety, this encryption method can only be decrypted to the original method using our decryption option at dSign. 
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Irreversible: </strong> This encryption method should be used for manufacturing work!
    When choosing the irreversible option, the signature remains whole while being embedded at a user-input basepair location in the sequence. 
    Both ends of the signature is connected to sticky ends of Type II restriction enzyme, allowing for the signature to cut away from the final product of the sequence.

<button class="collapsible"><strong>Where are the SEND and EXPORT files?</strong></button>
<div class="content">
  <p>
    After clicking SEND or EXPORT, the respective files exported can be found in your local directory's "project" folder.
    Use Send for sending your sequence files securely to others so that the guest then can access the sequence using our Guest tab.
    <br>
    <br>
    For Send: the files are named datacode.key and public.key
    <br>
    <br>
    For Export: the file is named seq# - where the # stands for which of the 5 sequences you exported.

<div class="card">
<div class="container">
<button class="collapsible"><strong>How can guests access the sequences?</strong></button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Guests are able to access a user's sequence without making a dSign account using the Guest features.
    From either the Nav bar or Home page, click Guest to be directed to a file upload page. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Upload the datacode.key and public.key received from a dSign user to access the sequence that is sent to you!
    <br>
    <br>
    Our secure-send feature allows the sequences to be sent without accessing our database, by generating key files that hold the sequence information securely.
    Our key is generated in the overall steps described below.

<div class="container">
<button class="collapsible"><strong>What limitations are (still) present?</strong></button>
<div class="content">
  <p> Unfornately, as great as dSign currently is, there are still some limitations present. 
    Due to financial constraints, we were unable to provide a bigger database to hold all the information and 
    currently, our users can only upload 5 sequences that are less than 255bps long. 
    Additionally, the platform is currently hosted locally (as you might be aware!) due to lack of funds to host globally. 
    <br>
    <br>
    However, each user may create multiple profiles to bypass the issue of 5 max sequences per account.
