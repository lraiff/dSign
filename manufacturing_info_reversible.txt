The reversible signature uses a type-II restriction enzyme (HindIII) that allows you to send the DNA sequence straight to manufacturing. 
In order to remove the signature, please do the following: 
Ensure 8-20 units/µl concentration in DNA synthesis
Ensure the cofactor Mg2+ is present 

Important information about HindIII:
Reaction temperature: 37°C
